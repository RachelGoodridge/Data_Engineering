## COVID-19 Cases vs. Vaccines in the United States
By: Rachel Goodridge

### Abstract
Using data about COVID-19 cases from Johns Hopkins University (found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/headsortails/covid19-us-county-jhu-data-demographics?select=covid_us_county.csv)) and COVID vaccines from the CDC (found [here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations)), I created an interactive website application that allows users to select and interpret various geospatial data plotted on an interactive map, create customizable dataframe queries, and observe visualizations of the changes in COVID cases and vaccines over time. It is meant to be informative to the general public, and ideally can be used to identify target locations that could benefit from public health outreach programs. I developed this app with streamlit and deployed it using GitHub. Draw conclusions and create your own interpretations by visiting the [website](https://share.streamlit.io/rachelgoodridge/data_engineering/main/streamlit/streamlit_app.py) and exploring the data.
